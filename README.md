# First Portfolio website

i built this one with React.JS, and react routing
this website was built right out of school as one of my projects, and for me to display my own projects and tell you about my self and what im good at. Everyday i try to learn somthing new and progress my life further and not stop, cause the day i stop is the day i fail.
